As of the Daimler AG company split, the Mercedes-Benz Cars division now handled the Mercedes-Benz- and the Smart-branded cars' production.[22]

Mercedes-AMG
Mercedes-AMG became a majority-owned division of Mercedes-Benz in 1999.[23] The company was integrated into DaimlerChrysler in 1999,[24] and became Mercedes-Benz AMG on 1 January 1999.[25]

Mercedes-Maybach
Daimler's ultraluxury Maybach brand was under the Mercedes-Benz Cars division until December 2012, when production was stopped due to decreased sales.[26] It now exists under the Mercedes-Maybach name, with the models being luxury-focused, enhanced models of Mercedes-Benz cars, such as the 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600.[27] The Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 SUV debuted in November 2019.[28]

China
Daimler partnered with BYD Auto to make and sell a battery-electric car called Denza in China.[29] However, after reducing its stake in 2021, the Stuttgart-based company has now exited Denza completely: the Mercedes-Benz Group is no longer involved in the Chinese car brand Denza, as it sold its last ten per cent stake in Denza in July 2024.[30] In 2016, Daimler announced plans to sell Mercedes-Benz-badged fully electric battery cars in China.[31] Beijing Benz is a joint venture with the BAIC Group to produce the Mercedes-Benz branded cars in China.[32]
